    title: About me
    summary: |
      I am a quantum and materials physicst by training. My research interests include, but not limited to,
      quantum mechanical simulation of materials. I am also interested in expanding 
      my research to the field of qunatum computing. I strongly believe that exploiting quantum mechanics 
      for computer simulations would change the way we live in the near future.
